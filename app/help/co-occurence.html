  <h2>Co-occurence</h2>
  <p>A list of terms which are most often annotated to the same proteins as the selected term, and the terms least often annotated to the same proteins.<p>

  <h3>Over represented terms</h3>
  <p>Terms which are over-represented in the proteins annotated to selected term, sorted by probability ratio.</p>

  <h3>Compared terms</h3>
  <p>Compared term: this is compared to the selected term</p>

  <h3>PR</h3>
  <p>Probability ratio</p>
  <p>Ratio of probability of compared term given selected term to probability of compared term
  =(#together/selected)/(#compared/#all)<p>
  <p>Probability of term here estimated as fraction of proteins annotated to term.</p>

  <h3>S%</h3>
  <p>Probability similarity ratio</p>
  <p>Ratio of probability of both terms to probability of either term<
  =#together/(#selected+#compared-#together)</p>
  <p>Probability of term here estimated as fraction of proteins annotated to term.</p>

  <h3>Together</h3>
  <p>Count of proteins where both selected and compared terms are annotated</p>

  <h3>Compared</h3>
  <p>Count of proteins where compared term is annotated</p>

  <h3>Selected</h3>
  <p>Total count of proteins annotated to selected term</p>

  <h3>All</h3>
  <p>Total count of proteins</p>
