  <h2>Using the term basket</h2>
  <p>Whenever you see a GO or ECO term ID on QuickGO, you will also see a basket icon appearing next to it. This icon allows you to add the term to your basket to save it for later use or to build up your own list. You can use your basket as an input to
    visualise the relationship between GO terms, create your own GO slims, use it to filter GO annotations, or simply export the list as .tsv file for your own use.</p>

  <p>The basket icon appears next to GO terms as shown below:</p>

  <p>Once you have added a term to your basket, the basket icon will change to green to indicate that the action has been completed. If you then see term IDs with a green basket icon next to them, you will know that these terms are already in your basket.</p>

  <p>You can click on the green basket icon to remove the term from your basket.</p>

  <p>You can access your basket at any time from the header bar.</p>
