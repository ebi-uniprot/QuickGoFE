<h4 id="q2">Searching for ontology terms and gene products</h4>
    <p>QuickGO provides a search box that allows you to search for GO terms (by name or ID), ECO terms (by name or ID) and gene product names. The search box is available in the centre of the main home page and in the page header on all other pages so you can always access it on any page of the website.

    <p>When you begin typing into the search box, you will see autocomplete suggestions appear in a dropdown box. The suggestions provide the top results that match your query divided into two types, Ontology term results and Gene product results. For every term or gene product shown in this dropdown, you can see the number of related GO annotations and click on this number directly to access the annotations.

    <p>For example, if you are interested in ‘Apoptosis’ and type this into the search box, you will see the results shown below:

    <p>You can click on the term IDs to go to the term pages or click on the number of annotations related to a term to view the annotations. You also see matching Gene products and can click on the number of annotations in the corresponding row to view these.

    <p>If you simply click on the ‘Search’ button instead of selecting any suggestions from the dropdown, you will see more results for ‘Terms’ and ‘Gene products’ on the results page.

    <p>If you would like to see more Term results or more Gene product results, you can click on the ‘Show all..’ links under the relevant subsection of results. For example, clicking on ‘Show all 329 results’ under ‘Terms’ will bring you to a detailed ‘Term’ results page with filters to help you narrow down your results.

<h4 id="q7">Using the term basket</h4>
    <p>Whenever you see a GO or ECO term ID on QuickGO, you will also see a basket icon appearing next to it. This icon allows you to add the term to your basket to save it for later use or to build up your own list. You can use your basket as an input to visualise the relationship between GO terms, create your own GO slims, use it to filter GO annotations, or simply export the list as .tsv file for your own use.

    <p>The basket icon appears next to GO terms as shown below:
    <br /><img src="images/basket1.png" />

    <p>Once you have added a term to your basket, the basket icon will change to green to indicate that the action has been completed. If you then see term IDs with a green basket icon next to them, you will know that these terms are already in your basket.

    <p>You can click on the green basket icon to remove the term from your basket.

    <p>You can access your basket at any time from the header bar.

    <p>Clicking on the ‘Basket’ link in the header will open your basket for further use, as shown below.
