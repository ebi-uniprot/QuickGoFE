  <h2>Searching for ontology terms and gene products</h2>
  <p>QuickGO provides a search box that allows you to search for GO terms (by name or ID), ECO terms (by name or ID) and gene product names. The search box is available in the centre of the main home page and in the page header on all other pages so you
    can always access it on any page of the website.</p>

  <p>When you begin typing into the search box, you will see autocomplete suggestions appear in a dropdown box. The suggestions provide the top results that match your query divided into two types, Ontology term results and Gene product results. For every
    term or gene product shown in this dropdown, you can see the number of related GO annotations and click on this number directly to access the annotations.</p>

  <p>For example, if you are interested in ‘Apoptosis’ and type this into the search box, you will see the results shown below:</p>

  <p>You can click on the term IDs to go to the term pages or click on the number of annotations related to a term to view the annotations. You also see matching Gene products and can click on the number of annotations in the corresponding row to view these.
  </p>

  <p>If you simply click on the ‘Search’ button instead of selecting any suggestions from the dropdown, you will see more results for ‘Terms’ and ‘Gene products’ on the results page.</p>

  <p>If you would like to see more Term results or more Gene product results, you can click on the ‘Show all..’ links under the relevant subsection of results. For example, clicking on ‘Show all 329 results’ under ‘Terms’ will bring you to a detailed ‘Term’
    results page with filters to help you narrow down your results.</p>
