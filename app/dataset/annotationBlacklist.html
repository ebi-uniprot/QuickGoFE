  <h2>Annotation Blacklist</h2>

  <h3>Scope</h3>

  <p>This method aims to correct annotations to UniProtKB accessions, from incorrect annotations inferred from
    electronic annotation (IEA) methods that are supplied by the UniProt-GOA project to the GO Consortium.</p>

  <h3>The Need For A Blacklist</h3>

  <p>The process of changing incorrect electronically inferred annotations is not instantaneous and in some cases
    these annotations are displayed for a while before the prediction method can be corrected at source.
    In some cases it is not possible for the IEA source to remove the annotation (see note 1, below).
    Example: False positives In the case where proteins are grouped together by a sequence model and the model hits
    a false positive, the 'false positive' protein would receive incorrect annotation(s).</p>

  <h3>Contents</h3>

  <p>This list contains UniProtKB protein accessions associated with specific GO terms that curators feel incorrectly
    describe a protein's function, associated process or subcellular location. This list is split into three
    sections:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><h4>Negative associations curated from IEA pipeline review</h4>

      <p>A list of protein-GO term associations that have been observed as being incorrect from the review of
        annotations
        obtained from an IEA pipeline. These associations are often added when a curator has observed that a
        function/process term is being over-predicted to a group of proteins.
        These associations are not present in the UniProt-GOA annotation set, as there is no published sequence or
        experimental data to specifically negate these associations. However, curator knowledge has been used to assert
        these undesirable associations.
        Note:
        Some electronic annotation sources have a cut-off criterion such that if the annotation is true for 95% of the
        proteins in the set, it is considered relevant for GO mappings to be added to the FULL protein set.
        This blacklist endeavours to highlight those proteins that may have been caught out in the 5% to provide users
        with as correct a set of protein annotations as possible.</p>
    </li>

    <li><h4>Negative associations obtained from NOT-qualified GO annotations (annotation set updated weekly)</h4>

      <p>These protein-GO term associations have been created when a protein has been expected to have a particular
        function, associated process or location, but specific experimental or sequence-based evidence has been curated
        to demonstrate the contrary. These NOT-qualified GO annotations are obtained from the current UniProt-GOA
        annotation set and are updated weekly. GO Consortium guidance on curator usage of the NOT-qualifier is available
        here: http://www.geneontology.org/GO.annotation.conventions.shtml#not</p>
    </li>

    <li><h4>Negative associations obtained from UniProt COMMENT_CAUTION entries (annotation set updated weekly)</h4>

      <p>These protein-GO term associations have been created when a 'caution' comment in the UniProt entry indicates
        that
        a protein does not have the expected function, process or location. These comments are added manually by UniProt
        curators after reviewing the sequence or literature.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Custodian of the blacklist</h3>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA" target="_blank">UniProt-GOA</a> project is responsible for maintaining
    the annotation blacklist for annotation sources originating from this group.</p>
