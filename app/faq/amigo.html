  <h3>Why do I get a different set of annotations when I look at the same gene/protein in AmiGO?</h3>

  <p>
    There are several ways in which <a href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/amigo/go.cgi" target="_blank">AmiGO</a> and QuickGO differ in display of annotations as follows:
  </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Update cycle; QuickGO updates with GO terms every day and with GO annotations every week, so for GO terms QuickGO should only be, at most, one day behind AmiGO and for GO annotations no more than one week. The dates on which the GO terms and annotations were last updated in QuickGO are displayed in the <a href="dataset" target="_blank">Dataset page</a> of QuickGO;</li>
        <li>AmiGO only provides electronic (IEA-coded) annotation for 12 model organism species whereas QuickGO provides electronic annotation for over 300,000 taxa in UniProtKB;</li>
        <li>Annotations from external groups are only incorporated into QuickGO if the external sequence identifiers can be mapped to valid (neither secondary or deleted) UniProtKB accession numbers;</li>
        <li>Annotations are only displayed in QuickGO if the GO identifier used has not been made secondary.</li>
    </ul>
