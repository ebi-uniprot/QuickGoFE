  <h3>I'd like to get a list of gene products which have all been annotated to the same GO term</h3>

  <p>You will first need to find the term that you are interested in. If you already know the term ID, you can directly paste it into the search box. If you don’t know the term ID, enter one or more words that might be present in the GO term’s name or synonyms
    in QuickGO’s search box. QuickGO will display a pop-up menu that contains the top five matches that it has found for your search keywords. If your term is in this menu, you can directly click on the ‘x annotations’ button to the right of your term
    to go to a page listing all gene products annotated for this term.</p>

  <p>If the term that you’re looking for does not appear in this list you can either refine the search criteria, or click on ‘Show all results’ link in the pop-up menu to go to a page that will list all of the matches that QuickGO has found. Once you have
    located the GO term you are interested in, click on it to go to the detailed term page. Here you will find a ‘x annotations’ button under the term definition. Clicking on this will take you to a page where all of the annotations that have used the
    term either directly or indirectly (by descendants of the selected term) are displayed for all applicable gene products. You can subsequently filter this set further using the 'Filter' button in the Annotation Toolbar; for instance to restrict the
    annotations for a specific taxon identifier.</p>
