  <h3>Can I download annotations for a list of gene products?</h3>
  <p>Firstly, open the <a href="http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/annotations" target="_blank">GO annotations page</a>, which is linked from the QuickGO home page (“View GO Annotations”).</p>

  <p>When you first load this page, it will show a table in which all the GO annotations available from UniProt-GOA are displayed.</p>

  <p>You can then refine this annotation set by filtering on a number of different criteria, and in this case you need to use the “Gene products” filter.</p>

  <p>To do this, click on the “Gene products” button above the list of annotations, and type (or paste) your list of gene product identifiers (which can be any combination of UniProtKB accessions, RNAcentral identifiers, and IntAct Complex Portal identifiers)
    into the text box at the top of the window that pops up below the button, then click the “Add” button; the list of annotations will be updated immediately. Note that the identifiers that you enter should be separated by spaces, tabs, new lines or
    commas.</p>

  <p>You can see various statistics relating to the filtered annotation set by clicking the “Statistics” tab above the annotation list.</p>

  <p>Finally, you can download the annotations in a number of different formats by clicking on the “Download” button in the “Annotations” tab. </p>
