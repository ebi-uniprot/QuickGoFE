  <h3>How do I make a GO Slim?</h3>

  <p>QuickGO allows you to use either a predefined GO slim (or a modified version of one), or your own set of GO terms as input to the slimming process.</p>

  <p>Firstly, open the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/slimming" target="_blank">slimming page</a>, which is linked from the QuickGO home page (“Explore Biology”).</p>

  <p>On the left hand side of the page you will see three tabs which allow you to specify which terms are to comprise your slim. If you want to use your own terms as a slim, then the second and third tabs (labelled “Input your own” and “Select from Basket”,
    respectively) are the ones that you will be using.</p>

  <p>These tabs allow you to either enter a list of GO terms (separated by spaces, commas, or newlines), or to select terms that you have already gathered in your Basket.</p>

  <p>To add terms from your Basket to your slim, select them using the checkboxes next to them, and then click on the “Add to selection” button; this will transfer the terms to the “Your selection” part of the page. Similarly, to add a list of terms that
    are not in your Basket, enter them in the text box on the “Input your own” tab, and then click on the “Add your Terms” button.</p>

  <p>If you want to find annotations for a specific set of gene products (or a particular taxonomic group), then you can enter the details in the “Additional options” section, on the right hand side of the page before clicking the “Apply” button; if you
    don’t use these additional filtering options, QuickGO will find annotations for all gene products, with their GO terms slimmed up to the terms in your selection</p>
