  <h3>I'd like to see all the annotations that used a particular PubMed reference</h3>
  <p>Firstly, open the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/annotations" target="_blank">GO annotations page</a>, which is linked from the QuickGO home page (“View GO Annotations”). </p>

  <p>You can filter the results shown on this page for a PubMed reference. Filtering options are presented as buttons above the results table. Click on ‘More’ to see all options. This will expand the filters and one of the options now available is ‘Reference’.
    Enter your PubMed ID in the box under the ‘Reference’ section, below the list of predefined options. Now click on the ‘add’ button. This will add your input to the list under ‘References’ and apply it as a filter simultaneously.</p>
