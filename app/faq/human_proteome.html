  <h3>I would like to see and download annotations for just the human proteome</h3>
  <p>Firstly, open the <a href="http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/annotations" target="_blank">GO annotations page</a>, which is linked from the QuickGO home page (“View GO Annotations”).</p>

  <p>The resulting page will show a table in which all the GO annotations available from UniProt-GOA are displayed. The annotation set can be filtered by specifying taxonomic identifiers. You can find taxon identifiers by searching <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/">UniProt Taxonomy</a>.</p>

  <p>To limit the results to the human taxon identifier, click on the ‘Taxon’ filter button above the list of annotations. To filter for taxon Human, just click on the checkbox next to '9606 Humo Spaiens'. Alternatively, you can add the taxon identifier(s)
    for any desired species, or taxonomic group(s) into the text box that appears in this Taxon filter.</p>

  <p>Statistics on the different aspects of this selected annotation set are available in the 'Statistics' tab of the results table.</p>
